The star undergoes spaghettification, producing a tidal stream of material that loops around the black hole. Some portion of the stellar material is captured into orbit, forming an accretion disk around the black hole, which emits electromagnetic radiation. In a small fraction of TDEs, a relativistic jet is also produced. As the material in the disk is gradually consumed by the black hole, the TDE fades over several months or years.</p>", "Umask": "<p>In computing, <b><code>umask</code></b> is a command that determines the settings of a mask that controls how file permissions are set for newly created files. It may also affect how the file permissions are changed explicitly. <code class=\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-text mw-content-ltr\" dir=\"ltr\">umask</code> is also a function that sets the mask, or it may refer to the mask itself, which is formally known as the <i><b>file mode creation mask</b></i>. The mask is a grouping of bits, each of which restricts how its corresponding permission is set for newly created files. The bits in the mask may be changed by invoking the <code class=\"mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-text mw-content-ltr\" dir=\"ltr\">umask</code> command.</p>", "FITS": "<p><b>Flexible Image Transport System</b> (<b>FITS</b>) is an open standard defining a digital file format useful for storage, transmission and processing of data: formatted as multi-dimensional arrays, or tables. FITS is the most commonly used digital file format in astronomy. The FITS standard was designed specifically for astronomical data, and includes provisions such as describing photometric and spatial calibration information, together with image origin metadata.</p>", "Zwicky_Transient_Facility": "<p>The <b>Zwicky Transient Facility</b> is a wide-field sky astronomical survey using a new camera attached to the Samuel Oschin Telescope at the Palomar Observatory in San Diego County, California, United States. Commissioned in 2018, it supersedes the (Intermediate) Palomar Transient Factory (2009\u20132017) that used the same observatory code. It is named after the Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky.</p>", "Pan-STARRS": "<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/2/2c/PanSTARRS4c_420.png/320px-PanSTARRS4c_420.png\" alt=\"Wikipedia thumbnail\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:10px;\"><p>The <b>Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System</b> located at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, US, consists of astronomical cameras, telescopes and a computing facility that is surveying the sky for moving or variable objects on a continual basis, and also producing accurate astrometry and photometry of already-detected objects. In January 2019 the second Pan-STARRS data release was announced. At 1.6 petabytes, it is the largest volume of astronomical data ever released.</p>", "Vera_C._Rubin_Observatory": "<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Large_Synoptic_Survey_Telescope_3_4_render_2013.png/320px-Large_Synoptic_Survey_Telescope_3_4_render_2013.png\" alt=\"Wikipedia thumbnail\" style=\"float:left; margin-right:10px;\"><p>The <b>Vera C. Rubin Observatory</b>, formerly known as the <b>Large Synoptic Survey Telescope</b> (<b>LSST</b>), is an astronomical observatory under construction in Chile. Its main task will be carrying out a synoptic astronomical survey, the <b>Legacy Survey of Space and Time</b>. The word \"<span class=\"extiw\">synoptic</span>\" is derived from the Greek words \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd and \u1f44\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2, and describes observations that give a broad view of a subject at a particular time. The observatory is located on the El Pe\u00f1\u00f3n peak of Cerro Pach\u00f3n, a 2,682-meter-high mountain in Coquimbo Region, in northern Chile, alongside the existing Gemini South and Southern Astrophysical Research Telescopes. The LSST Base Facility is located about 100 kilometres away from the observatory by road, in the town of La Serena. The observatory is named for Vera Rubin, an American astronomer who pioneered discoveries about galaxy rotation rates.</p>", "Mean_shift": "<p><b>Mean shift</b> is a non-parametric feature-space mathematical analysis technique for locating the maxima of a density function, a so-called mode-seeking algorithm.
